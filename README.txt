address found for IMU soldered to Curent pico is 0x68

Kalman filter implemented.
 - Not very stable but giving a good estimate of what the angle is
 - If I spent the time to tune im confident i could get a more stable angle reading

Next I need to add the magnetometer to the system to get my heading. 
 - magnetomoter part number is 
 - magnetometer address found as 0x0d
 - 
Following the magnetometer will be adding an rf transmitter and reciever so that i can send control input
